# Built-Up Area Expansion Analysis (2000–2025)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`built_up_analysis.ipynb`) focused on analyzing the annual expansion of built-up areas from the year 2000 to 2025, along with the contributing factors influencing this growth using multiple linear regression analysis.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Simulate yearly built-up area data from 2000 to 2025.
- Identify and incorporate at least five independent variables that contribute to urban expansion, such as:
  - Population Growth
  - GDP per Capita
  - Road Network Expansion
  - Land Use Policies
  - Distance to City Center
- Perform Multiple Linear Regression to quantify each variable’s contribution to built-up expansion.
- Ensure code is reproducible and well-documented for future use or extension.

## 🧠 Tools and Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Anaconda Environment**
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration

## 📊 Key Results

- The regression model evaluates the influence of each variable on urban expansion.
- Annual trends and variable impacts are visualized through plots and tables.
- Insights are provided to inform urban planning and policy decisions.
